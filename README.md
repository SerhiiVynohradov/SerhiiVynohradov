### Hi, I'm Serge - a Ruby on Rails Developer, Web Platform Architect and Mathematician with a passion for building and analyzing web startups.

With over 9 years of experience in software development, I've had the opportunity to work on complex web applications ranging from social networks to investment platforms.

As a critical thinker and problem solver, I have a strong ability to analyze and identify potential issues in a project and design solutions that effectively address them. My extensive experience with architecture and database modeling, unit and feature testing, API integration, profiling systems, and performance optimization allows me to deliver high-quality results in a timely manner.

Beyond my technical expertise, I bring a unique perspective to my work thanks to my background in Computational Linguistics and a deep interest in Mathematics. I've developed a variety of scientific analytics approaches and tools, including mind mapping and various types of diagrams, to help me plan and visualize complex projects.

Currently, I am working full-time at Gotoinc, where I have contributed to the successful development and acquisition of a highly successful international real estate investment platform, Update Capital, for the US and Canada markets. I'm well-versed in Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, AWS S3, Heroku, ActiveAdmin, Bitbucket, Capybara, DelayedJob, DeviceTwoFactor, Devise, Geocoder, JQuery, PDFTK, Puma, RSpec, Ruby, Seeds, Twitter Bootstrap, and Webmock.

In my free time, I love making mind maps, studying mathematics, and spending time with my cat Musia. If you're interested in working together or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me.
